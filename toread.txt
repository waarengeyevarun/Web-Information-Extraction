Here is no doubt at all that a reconsideration of the law on adultery is long overdue. By agreeing to have another look at the constitutional validity of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, under which men can be prosecuted for adultery, the Supreme Court has re-opened a question that has been decided thrice in the past. This time the court will have to do more than pronounce on whether the provision discriminates against men on the basis of gender and gives an unconstitutional exemption to women. While agreeing to issue notice to the government, the Bench has observed that the provision is archaic. It has further noted that in a case of adultery, one person is liable for the offence but the other is absolved, and that the concept of gender neutrality, on which criminal law normally proceeds, is absent. The court has also noted that once the consent or connivance of the husband is established, there is no offence of adultery at all. It rightly describes this as subordination of a woman and something that “creates a dent on the independent identity of a woman”.
